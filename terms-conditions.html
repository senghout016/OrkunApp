                        <h3>1. Our Purpose</h3>
                        <p>Orkun helps connect customers who are looking for services, to Service Providers that are listed on our system (“Service Professional”). By providing an online platform that taps on the social network connections of consumers and Service Providers, we help consumers make more informed decisions when choosing a Service Providers, and help service providers reach out to more targeted customers.
                            Orkun also allows customers to submit a request for a service and either receive a few introductions from Service Providers who are interested to perform the service or get a dedicated Service Professional (Express request) . The customer and Service Providers can then discuss and negotiate on the platform, agree to talk or meet in person and agree to transact. It is important to note that in agreeing to pay a certain price for a defined scope of service, the customer is entering into an agreement with the Service Providers directly. Orkun provides an advertising and marketing platform for the Service Providers and facilitates payments collection, and is NOT INVOLVED in the fulfilment of the agreement or performing the service.

                        <p>Orkun charges Service Providers when they upgrade their accounts to include additional services. All payments must be conducted either through online transfer from a valid bank account, or a credit or debit card, or cheque. Orkun retains the right to refuse any request or transaction made by you, to our discretion.</p>
                        <p>Failure to pay may result in the termination of your service. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or downgrade your account, you authorise us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>
                        <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to transact with Orkun.</p>

                        <p>Customers are highly encouraged to use the Orkun Pay system to ensure that you are always protected for the full value of your job. Do insist to the Service Professional that you prefer Orkun Pay instead of cash, and there should be no difference in terms of the price you pay.</p>
                        <p>Upon agreeing to a certain scope of work at a certain price, the Service Providers may send a request for payment to Customers through the Orkun Pay system. Alternatively, Customers can click “Make a Payment” and pay via ABA bank and attach the receipt to app. Please note we will be required to pass your information to the payment provider for the purposes of payment tracking, but all payment information is managed by them and we do not retain any payment information. Customers can choose to only release a portion of the payment made by you to the Service Professional in order for him to commence work.  This amount is final and non-refundable.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving the Request for Payment from the Service Professional, Customers can choose to pay 10% to 100% of the total amount. Orkun will retain all the money until the job has been completed and confirmed by both Service Providers and Customers.</p>

                        <p>In addition, if Customers paid using Orkun Pay (either pre-paying for a service before the job is done or using Orkun Pay after the job is done), Customers will enjoy a money-back guarantee for any uncompleted portions of work, as long as the customer hasn’t released the funds to the service professional.</p>
